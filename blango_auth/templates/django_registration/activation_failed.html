<!-- 
If the activation were to fail, namely due to an invalid key, the activation_failed.html template is rendered

It is passed the context variable activation_error, which is a dictionary containing information about why the activation failed. 
The most useful keys are:

code: The failure exception code, a string.
message: A message/description of the exception.
Code will be one of the following:
already_activated: Indicates the account has already been activated.
bad_username: Indicates the username decoded from the activation key is invalid (does not correspond to any user account).
expired: Indicates the account/activation key has expired.
invalid_key: Generic indicator that the activation key was invalid.

You should be able to just show the user activation_error.message in the template.
